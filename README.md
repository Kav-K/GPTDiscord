# Requirements
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

OpenAI API Key (https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

Discord Bot Token (https://discord.com/developers/applications)

You can learn how to add the discord bot to your server via https://www.ionos.co.uk/digitalguide/server/know-how/creating-discord-bot/

Both the OpenAI API key and the Discord bot token needed to be loaded into a .env file in the same local directory as the bot file.

You also need to add a DEBUG_GUILD id and a DEBUG_CHANNEL id, the debug guild id is a server id, and the debug channel id is a text-channel id in Discord. Your final .env file should look like the following:

```
OPENAI_TOKEN="<openai_api_token>"

DISCORD_TOKEN="<discord_bot_token>"

DEBUG_GUILD="974519864045756446"   #discord_server_id

DEBUG_CHANNEL="977697652147892304"  #discord_chanel_id
```
