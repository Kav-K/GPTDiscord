# Features
- **Directly prompt GPT3 with `!g <prompt>`**

- **Have conversations with the bot, just like chatgpt, with `!g converse`** - Conversations happen in threads that get automatically cleaned up!

- **DALL-E Image Generation** - Generate DALL-E AI images right in discord with `!draw <prompt>`! It even supports multiple image qualities, multiple images, creating image variants, retrying, and saving images.

- **Redo Requests** - A simple button after the GPT3 response or DALL-E generation allows you to redo the initial prompt you asked.

- **DALL-E Image Prompt Optimization** - Given some text that you're trying to generate an image for, the bot will automatically optimize the text to be more DALL-E friendly!

- Change and view model parameters such as temp, top_p, and etc directly within discord. 
- Tracks token usage automatically
- Automatic pagination and discord support, the bot will automatically send very long message as multiple messages, and is able to send discord code blocks and emoji, gifs, etc.
- A low usage mode, use a command to automatically switch to a cheaper and faster model to conserve your tokens during times of peak usage. 
- Prints debug to a channel of your choice, so you can view the raw response JSON
- Ability to specify a limit to how long a conversation can be with the bot, to conserve your tokens.


# Requirements
`python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

**I recommend using python 3.9!**

OpenAI API Key (https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/introduction)

Discord Bot Token (https://discord.com/developers/applications)

You can learn how to add the discord bot to your server via https://www.ionos.co.uk/digitalguide/server/know-how/creating-discord-bot/

Both the OpenAI API key and the Discord bot token needed to be loaded into a .env file in the same local directory as the bot file.

You also need to add a DEBUG_GUILD id and a DEBUG_CHANNEL id, the debug guild id is a server id, and the debug channel id is a text-channel id in Discord. Your final .env file should look like the following:

```
OPENAI_TOKEN="<openai_api_token>"

DISCORD_TOKEN="<discord_bot_token>"

DEBUG_GUILD="974519864045756446"   #discord_server_id

DEBUG_CHANNEL="977697652147892304"  #discord_chanel_id
```

Optionally, you can include your own conversation starter text for the bot that's used with `!g converse`, with `CONVERSATION_STARTER_TEXT`

## Bot on discord:

- Create a new Bot on Discord Developer Portal:
    - Applications -> New Application
- Generate Toker for the app (discord_bot_token)
    - Select App (Bot) -> Bot -> Reset Token
- Toogle PRESENCE INTENT:
    - Select App (Bot) -> Bot -> PRESENCE INTENT
- Add Bot the the server.
    - Select App (Bot) -> OAuth2 -> URL Generator -> Select Scope: Bot
    - Bot Permissions will appear, select the desired permissions
    - Copy the link generated below and paste it on the browser
    - On add to server select the desired server to add the bot

# Usage

`python3.9 main.py`

# Commands

`!g` - Display help text for the bot

`!g converse` - Start a conversation with the bot, like ChatGPT

`!g end` - End a conversation with the bot.

`!draw <prompt>` - Have DALL-E generate images based on a prompt

`!gp` - Display settings for the model (temperature, top_p, etc)

`!gs <setting> <value>` - Change a model setting to a new value

`!g <prompt>` Ask the GPT3 Davinci 003 model a question.

`!gu` Estimate current usage details (based on davinci)

`!gs low_usage_mode True/False` Turn low usage mode on and off. If on, it will use the curie-001 model, and if off, it will use the davinci-003 model.

`!imgoptimize <image prompt text>` Optimize a given prompt text for DALL-E image generation.

`!delete_all_conversation_threads` - Delete all threads related to this bot across all servers.

# Configuration

All the model parameters are configurable inside discord. Type `!gp` to view all the configurable parameters, and use `!gs <param> <value>` to set parameters. For example, if I wanted to change the number of images generated by DALL-E by default to 4, I can type the following command in discord: `!gs num_images 4`
