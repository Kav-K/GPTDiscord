# AI-Assisted Google Search
This bot supports searching google for answers to your questions with assistance from GPT3! To get started, you need to get a Google Custom Search API key, and a Google Custom Search Engine ID. You can then define these as follows in your `.env` file:
```env
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY="...."
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID="...."
```

You first need to create a programmable search engine and get the search engine ID: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/docs/tutorial/creatingcse

Then you can get the API key, click the "Get a key" button on this page: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction
