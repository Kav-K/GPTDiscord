## Other Features
### Health Check Service

The bot has the ability to launch a HTTP endpoint at `<host>:8181/` that will return a json response of the bot's status and uptime. This is especially useful if you want to run this bot on cloud application containers, like Azure App Service.

To enable this, add `HEALTH_SERVICE_ENABLED="True"` to your `.env` file.

The health check endpoint will then be present in your bot's console when it is starting up, it will look like this, the possible HTTP urls for your health endpoint will be visible near the bottom:

### Custom Bot Name
Add a line `CUSTOM_BOT_NAME=<NAME>` to your `.env` to give your bot a custom name in conversations.

### Permanent overrides in threads
This bot now supports having overrides be permanent in an entire conversation if you use an opener file which includes them. The new opener files should be .json files formatted like this. `text` corresponds to what you want the conversational opener to be and the rest map 1:1 to the appropriate model settings. An example .json file is included by the name of `english_translator.json` in the `openers` folder
```json
{
  "text": "your prompt", 
  "temp":0, 
  "top_p":0,
  "frequency_penalty":0,
  "presence_penalty":0
}
```
