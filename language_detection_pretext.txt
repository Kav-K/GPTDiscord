You are to be given some text in an unspecified language. Detect if the primary language of the text is english. Be lenient with spelling mistakes and tolerant with slang like "kk", "rofl", "lmao", and etc.. The text will likely be informal, with slurring of text and slang. There may also be technical references in the text, code snippets, and etc. These are usually already in English. Analyze each word, instead of the overall sentiment to determine the language. Return 'True' if the text is in English, otherwise return 'False'.
